    "# The relationship between spatial coupling and incidence correlation in a 2-patch model\n",
    "Now that we have extensively demonstrated and validated the single-patch behavior of different LASER models, it's finally time to demonstrate LASER in a spatial modeling context - in this case, not explicitly spatial but rather a multi-patch model with connection matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will aim to replicate the findings in Keeling & Rohani, _Estimating spatial coupling in epidemiological systems: a mechanistic approach_, Ecol. Letters (2002) 5:20-29, where the authors analyze a 2-patch SIR system and develop a relationship between the parameter governing the ratio of \"within vs. between\" coupling of infectives and susceptibles in the two patches, and the correlation in the time series of infections in the two patches.  Readers can turn to that publication for a full reproduction of the analysis; here we will introduce the system (using our notation established in the other notebooks, rather than that of the paper) and skip ahead to stating the result we want to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a system of two coupled patches, of equal population $N$, birthrate $\\mu$, and mortality rate $\\nu$, coupled by parameter $\\sigma$ such that in each patch, a fraction $\\sigma$ of infectiveness is \"sent\" to the other node, with the remaining $(1-\\sigma)$ \"staying local\".  \n",

    "where $C$ is the time-series correlation between $I_1$ and $I_2$, $\\sigma$ is again the coupling constant as defined above, and $\\xi$ is a constant that depends on the other model parameters $\\mu, \\nu, \\beta, \\gamma$.   They find a value $\\xi = 0.0119$ for a particular instantiation of their model (run for 5000-year samples), and we will roughly replicate their parametrization and find that we can recapitulate the sigmoidal behavior and fit a similar value of $\\xi$.  It's important to note that this is an empirical constant and we can move the exact value of it by changing e.g., the length of time over which we compute the correlation - we consider it sufficient validation to demonstrate the sigmoidal relationship between $C$ and $\\sigma$, with a value of $\\xi$ in the same order of magnitude.\n"

    "As noted before - since these are finite time simulations and we are not running for 5000 years like the original paper, the choice of window over which to compute correlation can affect the outputs.  The particular choice of the last 25 years was chosen to land us with a value quite close to the original value - if you adjust the window of computation to be the last 10 years, or last 75 years, etc. you can shift the fitted value of $\\xi$ around by a factor of 2-3 either direction.  This is not unexpected - it takes some  time for this system to settle out of its early transient dynamics into a regime where we can reliably compute this correlation, and in fact, that time likely depends strongly on the value of the connection coefficient.  We view it as sufficient demonstration to recapture the sigmoidal relationship, and show that we can recover values of $\\xi$ of similar order of magnitude as the analytic result presented in the reference manuscript."
